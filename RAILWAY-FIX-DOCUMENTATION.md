# Railway Deployment Fix Documentation

## Issue Resolution

This fix addresses the Railway deployment issue where a status/landing page was being displayed instead of the actual VS Code web interface.

## Root Cause

The original `railway-server-production.mjs` was designed to serve a custom HTML status page instead of launching the actual code-server binary. The script would:

1. Check for VS Code build files
2. If not found, serve a custom status page with "fallback mode" message
3. Never actually launch the VS Code server

## Solution

### Changes Made

1. **Created new startup script**: `railway-server-production-fixed.mjs`
   - Directly launches code-server binary
   - Removes all status page middleware
   - Configures code-server with proper Railway settings

2. **Updated package.json scripts**:
   - `start`: Points to the fixed script
   - `railway:start`: Points to the fixed script  
   - `start:direct`: Added for direct code-server launch
   - `railway:build`: Simplified (no compilation needed)

3. **Updated railway.toml**:
   - Removed custom health check path
   - Code-server handles its own health checks

4. **Updated Dockerfile.codeserver**:
   - Uses the fixed startup script
   - Health check points to root path instead of /healthz

5. **Added to .gitignore**:
   - Excluded .backup/ directory

### Code-server Configuration

The fixed script launches code-server with these settings:
- Bind address: `0.0.0.0:PORT`
- Authentication: Password-based
- Workspace: Railway volume mount or /tmp/workspace
- Disabled telemetry and update checks
- Custom app name: GIDE

### Environment Variables

Required:
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 8080)
- `PASSWORD`: Access password (default: 'defaultpassword')

Optional:
- `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN`: For URL logging
- `RAILWAY_VOLUME_MOUNT_PATH`: Custom workspace path

## Testing

Run the configuration test:
```bash
node scripts/test-configuration.mjs
```

## Deployment

1. Commit and push changes
2. Railway will rebuild using Dockerfile.codeserver
3. Code-server will launch directly
4. VS Code web interface will be accessible at the Railway domain

## Files Modified

- `scripts/railway-server-production-fixed.mjs` (new)
- `package.json` (scripts updated)
- `railway.toml` (health check removed)
- `Dockerfile.codeserver` (startup script updated)
- `.gitignore` (backup exclusion added)

## Files Backed Up

- `.backup/railway-server-production.mjs`
- `.backup/vscode-fallback.html`

## Verification

After deployment, the Railway URL should:
1. Show VS Code authentication prompt
2. After password entry, display full VS Code interface
3. No longer show status/landing page
