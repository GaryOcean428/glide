# GIDE Deployment Stability Maintenance Schedule

## Overview
This document outlines the automated and manual maintenance schedule for ensuring deployment stability and preventing future outages in the GIDE project.

## Automated Monitoring Schedule

### Daily Monitoring (CI/CD)
- **Frequency**: On every push/PR to main/develop branches
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/validate-deploy.yml`)
- **Checks Performed**:
  - Build compilation validation
  - Security audit (moderate+ vulnerabilities)
  - Deployment configuration verification
  - Health endpoint testing
  - Performance budget compliance

### Weekly Maintenance (Automated)
- **Frequency**: Sundays at 2 AM UTC (configurable)
- **Automation**: `scripts/weekly-audit.sh` (can be scheduled via cron)
- **Checks Performed**:
  - Comprehensive dependency security audit
  - Outdated package analysis
  - Build health verification (with timing)
  - Bundle size analysis and budget compliance
  - Deployment configuration validation
  - Health endpoint testing
  - Log cleanup (removes logs >30 days)

**Example Cron Setup:**
```bash
# Add to crontab for weekly execution
0 2 * * 0 cd /path/to/gide && ./scripts/weekly-audit.sh >> /var/log/gide-maintenance.log 2>&1
```

### Continuous Health Monitoring
- **Frequency**: Every 30 seconds (configurable via HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL)
- **Endpoint**: `/health` and `/healthz`
- **Timeout**: 5 seconds (configurable via HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT)
- **Integration**: Railway platform + custom validation

## Manual Maintenance Schedule

### Monthly Review Process
**First Monday of each month - 2 hours allocated**

#### Performance Budget Review (30 minutes)
- Review bundle size trends from weekly reports
- Adjust performance budgets in `budget.json` if needed
- Identify optimization opportunities
- Update performance targets based on growth

#### Security Assessment (45 minutes)
- Review accumulated security vulnerabilities
- Evaluate breaking change tolerance for security updates
- Plan dependency upgrade strategy
- Update security policies if needed

#### Infrastructure Optimization (30 minutes)
- Review Railway deployment metrics
- Analyze build performance trends
- Optimize resource allocation
- Update deployment configurations

#### Documentation Updates (15 minutes)
- Update `docs/deployment-fixes.md` with new findings
- Review and update maintenance procedures
- Update contact information and escalation procedures

### Quarterly Full Review
**First week of quarters (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct) - 4 hours allocated**

#### Complete Deployment Process Review (2 hours)
- End-to-end deployment testing
- Rollback procedure validation
- Update emergency response procedures
- Review monitoring effectiveness

#### Technology Stack Assessment (1 hour)
- Evaluate Node.js version upgrade needs
- Review major dependency updates
- Assess new monitoring tools
- Plan technology modernization

#### Performance Analysis (1 hour)
- Comprehensive performance metrics review
- Compare against industry benchmarks
- Set new performance targets
- Plan optimization roadmap

## Emergency Response Schedule

### Immediate Response (< 15 minutes)
1. **Detection**: Automated health check failure or manual report
2. **Assessment**: Quick health endpoint verification
3. **Communication**: Alert development team
4. **Initial Response**: Health check analysis using monitoring tools

### Short-term Response (< 1 hour)
1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Review CI/CD logs and metrics
2. **Decision Making**: Rollback vs. hotfix evaluation
3. **Implementation**: Execute rollback or deploy hotfix
4. **Verification**: Confirm issue resolution

### Post-Incident Review (< 24 hours)
1. **Documentation**: Update incident log
2. **Process Review**: Identify improvement opportunities
3. **Preventive Measures**: Implement additional monitoring if needed
4. **Schedule Update**: Adjust maintenance schedule if required

## Monitoring Tools and Commands

### Daily Operations
```bash
# Check deployment health
npm run railway:health

# Quick security audit
npm run security-audit

# Validate deployment readiness
./scripts/deployment-rollback.sh validate
```

### Weekly Maintenance
```bash
# Full weekly audit
./scripts/weekly-audit.sh

# Dependency analysis
npm run dependency-check

# Performance check
npm run performance-check
```

### Emergency Procedures
```bash
# List stable tags for rollback
./scripts/deployment-rollback.sh list

# Create emergency tag before changes
./scripts/deployment-rollback.sh tag

# Emergency rollback
./scripts/deployment-rollback.sh rollback stable-YYYYMMDD-HHMM
```

## Success Metrics Tracking

### Weekly Metrics (Automated via weekly-audit.sh)
- Build success rate: >95%
- Build time: <30 seconds average
- Security vulnerabilities: Zero high-severity
- Performance budget compliance: 100%

### Monthly Metrics (Manual review)
- Deployment failure rate: <5%
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR): <1 hour
- Incident frequency: <2 per month
- Uptime: >99.5%

### Quarterly Metrics (Comprehensive review)
- Overall system stability score
- Performance improvement percentage
- Security posture assessment
- Technology debt reduction

## Alert Thresholds

### Critical Alerts (Immediate Response)
- Health endpoint failure (>3 consecutive failures)
- Build failure rate >20% in 24 hours
- High-severity security vulnerabilities detected
- Performance budget exceeded by >50%

### Warning Alerts (Same-day Response)
- Build time exceeding 45 seconds
- Moderate security vulnerabilities accumulating
- Performance budget exceeded by >25%
- Dependency updates available for >30 days

### Info Alerts (Weekly Review)
- Minor security vulnerabilities
- Performance optimization opportunities
- Non-critical dependency updates
- Documentation outdated

## Contact and Escalation

### Primary Contacts
